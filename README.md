# What is Dotto?
Dotto is just the fancy name for my dotfiles repository and (def not stolen) programs and scripts!

# How do I install Dotto?
First of all, this is [my](github.com/citizensixtynine) personal dotfiles. Some stuff may be broken or might require some programs (listed below)

But overall, just `git clone` this repository and then just copy and paste the folder's files in their respective directories (like the .bashrc in your /home/ and such).

# What software and stuff does Dotto support?

+ Bash
+ Alacritty
+ Discord (through Powercord)
+ /etc/hosts
