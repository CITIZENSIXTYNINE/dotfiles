# Leila's Dotfiles
This is a collection of my dotfiles.

# Software
So far this is the following software that are in here:
+ Bash
+ Discord (Powercord)
+ Alacritty
+ Vim

# License
This compilation of config files is licensed under the [YMGv2](https://github.com/CITIZENSIXTYNINE/YMG-v2) license by Leila Pineda.

# Other stuff
You can use these files but you'll need to tweak some stuff like Alacritty's YML file or Bash's bashrc file.
